![Foundry v12](https://img.shields.io/badge/foundry-v12-green)

This game system for [Foundry Virtual Tabletop](https://foundryvtt.com/) provides character sheet and game system support for [Godbound: A Game of Divine Heroes](https://sine-nomine-publishing.myshopify.com/collections/godbound/Godbound) by [Kevin Crawford]().

This sytem provides character sheet support for Actors and Items, mechanical support for dice and rules necessary to play games of Godbound.

## Installation Instructions

This system is still in early development and is not listed in the official Foundry package listing, but is available through the repository's [Releases](https://github.com/Sparky939/godbound/releases) page. You can install the system by pasting the following URL into the **Install System** dialog on the Setup menu of the application.

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sparky939/godbound/refs/heads/main/system.json

You can also perform a manual install by downloading one of the .zip archives from the Releases page and extracting it into your foundry Data folder, under `Data/systems/godbound`.

Given the current nature of the project I strongly recommend regularly backing up your worlds before updates
